  One of the more technically nuanced projects I worked on involved supporting
  and upgrading the website for <strong>La Brea Bakery</strong>. Our team
  inherited this site from a previous agency, which meant stepping into a stack
  and setup we didn’t originally architect. The site itself runs on
  <strong>Drupal 9</strong>, with deployment handled through
  <strong>Pantheon’s CI/CD pipeline</strong>. From the start, we focused on
  stabilizing and extending the infrastructure in ways that gave both our
  internal team and the client more flexibility and control over future
  development.

  To make development smoother, we created an
  <strong>offline version of the site using Docker</strong>. This allowed us to
  work safely and efficiently without affecting the live environment. We also
  improved how feedback was collected by integrating
  <strong>BugHerd</strong> for in-depth ticketing and streamlined communication
  between the client and our developers. This improved turnaround times and made
  it much easier to prioritize changes across different departments.

  Throughout the engagement, we were asked to build a number of
  <strong>custom landing pages</strong> that didn’t rely on the existing Drupal
  templates. One example was a dedicated page promoting their new cookbook,
  which needed to feel modern and branded while being easy for the client to
  update later on. Working outside of the default theme meant we had to create
  flexible, reusable components that still adhered to their overall site style
  and SEO standards.

  One of the largest tasks was upgrading the entire site from
  <strong>Drupal 9 to Drupal 10</strong>. Initially, we began this process using
  Docker, but midway through the project we made the decision to move to
  <strong>DDEV</strong>, which significantly streamlined our local development
  and testing. The upgrade wasn’t just a cosmetic change—it was driven by
  security. Drupal 9 was nearing end-of-life, and vulnerabilities were beginning
  to propagate more rapidly. Our client was eager to upgrade for peace of mind,
  but that meant we had to carefully work through
  <strong>layers of module dependencies</strong>, some of which were deprecated
  or unmaintained.

<p>
  In many cases, we had to find alternatives or write custom solutions to
  replace modules that wouldn’t make the jump to Drupal 10. It was a complex
  puzzle of backwards compatibility and forward thinking, but it was also a
  chance to do a deep dive into the Drupal ecosystem and come out with a much
  stronger, more stable foundation for the future. If you’re dealing with a
  legacy Drupal site or want help making the leap to Drupal 10, I’d be glad to
  help guide the process.
