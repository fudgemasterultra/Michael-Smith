  One of the more rewarding projects I’ve worked on was helping bring the
  <strong>Scott County, VA tourism kiosk</strong> to life. This project was
  built completely in-house by our team, from idea to implementation. The goal
  was to create a digital experience that would showcase more than just the
  usual outdoor highlights—like the Devil’s Bathtub and popular hiking
  trails—but instead help represent the full identity of Scott County, including
  its local businesses, cultural sites, and events.

  The kiosk runs on Android 11 and was developed using
  <strong>Flutter and Dart</strong>. This choice gave us the flexibility to
  deliver a smooth, modern experience that felt native, while still being easy
  to maintain and update over time. We worked hard to make sure accessibility
  was part of the design process from the very beginning. The kiosks themselves
  are mounted on <strong>wheelchair-accessible stands</strong>, and all
  on-screen interactions follow ADA-friendly best practices like large tap
  targets and intuitive navigation.

  My role focused on the implementation and development side. I worked alongside
  a UX designer to bring the vision to life, making sure the app wasn’t just
  functional but also visually appealing and welcoming for tourists. One of the
  standout features we added was an <strong>e-postcard service</strong>.
  Visitors could select a photo from a gallery of scenic shots, write their own
  personalized message, and send it to friends and family directly from the
  kiosk. It was a small but memorable touch that helped people share their
  experience in a meaningful way.

  Another major feature was the ability to download Scott County’s official
  travel guide. We set this up to collect users’ email addresses before the
  download, which gave the tourism team a way to follow up with more information
  or promotions down the road. On the backend, we connected the app to their
  existing WordPress website, pulling in upcoming events and new attractions
  automatically. This ensured that the kiosk stayed
  <strong>fresh and relevant</strong> without requiring constant manual updates.

  This project meant a lot to the county, and to me personally. It was a chance
  to use tech to tell a more complete story of a place—one that deserves to be
  seen in its entirety, not just for its Instagram-worthy nature spots. And from
  a technical side, it was a great opportunity to dive deep into Flutter, work
  with accessibility standards, and build something physical that real people
  interact with in public spaces. If you're looking for help building a digital
  kiosk experience, I’d be happy to talk more about what I’ve learned from this
  project and how I can apply it to yours.
